 This library gives explicit access to the following groups of order 1024: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  The rank 1 group 
\item  All rank 2 groups 
\item  All rank 3 groups 
\item  All rank 4 groups 
\item  Rank 5 groups with p-class at least 3 
\item  Rank 6 groups with p-class at least 3 
\item  Rank 7 groups with p-class at least 3 
\item  Rank 8 groups with p-class at least 3 
\item  Rank 9 groups with p-class at least 3 
\item  The rank 10 group 
\end{itemize}
 

 This library gives partial information on the remaining groups of order 1024: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Rank 5 groups with p-class 2 
\item  Rank 6 groups with p-class 2 
\item  Rank 7 groups with p-class 2 
\item  Rank 8 groups with p-class 2 
\item  Rank 9 groups with p-class 2 
\end{itemize}
 

 For the groups that are not explicitly available the following information is
available: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Parent Group ID 
\item  Parent Group Order 
\item  p-class 
\item  Rank 
\item  Age 
\end{itemize}
 

 The groups are sorted first by their parent group ids and then by the pc codes
of the standard presentations for the groups. The data contained in this
library was used in the 2021 enumeration of the groups of order 1024 \cite{Burrell2021a}. The available groups were generated using the p-group generation algorithm \cite{OBrien1990a} as implemented in the ANUPQ package \cite{Gamble2019a}. The information on the remaining groups was calculated using the
cohomological methods for enumerating p-groups of p-class 2 as introduced in \cite{Eick1999a}.

 Once the package is loaded the user may call \texttt{SmallGroup(1024,i)} and receive either a group if available or a \emph{partially constructed group} which has the following attributes set 
\begin{itemize}
\item  p-class 
\item  Rank 
\item  Heritage 
\item  Order
